## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach, including the following steps:

1. **Data Understanding:** Exploring the dataset, identifying quality issues, and understanding the data's structure.

2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.

3. **Modeling:** Building regression models, evaluating their performance, and selecting the best model.

4. **Findings:** Presenting key findings related to the factors influencing used car prices.

5. **Recommendations:** Providing actionable recommendations for inventory optimization and pricing strategy.

6. **Next Steps:** Suggesting potential areas for further analysis or improvement.

## Data Understanding

In the data understanding phase, we explored the dataset's key characteristics, including its size, columns, and initial quality issues. We conducted descriptive statistics and identified patterns in the data.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation phase involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing it for modeling. Feature engineering and data transformation were performed to enhance the quality of the dataset.

## Modeling

We built regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to predict used car prices. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Findings

Our analysis identified several key findings related to the factors influencing used car prices. These findings are presented in a clear and concise manner.

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we offer actionable recommendations for inventory optimization and pricing strategy to assist the used car dealership in improving business outcomes.

## Next Steps

We suggest potential next steps for further data analysis, model fine-tuning, and data quality improvement to enhance the project's results.
